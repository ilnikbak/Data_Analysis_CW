Educational projects

### Goal
The business task is to prepare an analytical report based on the available data, which will later help the producers of educational programs to effectively build a strategy for modernizing and improving courses.
### Tasks
1. Calculation of the potential load on teachers in order to assess the need to expand the staff.
2. Analysis of the quality of course content, where it is necessary to identify problematic modules that may need to be improved.
3. Determine if potential seasonality exists.
